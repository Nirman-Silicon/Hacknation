## About Project
Whenever we go to a fruit, vegetable or a grocery shop where things are put on a view, there at the time of rush hour we often ask the shopkeeper to tell the price of the thing. After that we decide wheather we will buy it or not. Thus there leads to wastage of time. In the other way around, during rush hours, the shopkeeper might get irrited and might ignore us or it might turn into on heated conversation. Thus to solve this problem, we team GENISIS has come up with an AR integrated app which will display the price of the things we want to buy. Addition to it there is a payment fatwway which leads to payment of the product.
