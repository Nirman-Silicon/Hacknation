## About Project
Campus Health Hub is an online platform that aims to improve the emergency response system
and healthcare access for college students. The platform connects students with medical
professionals through virtual consultations, and facilitates the swift communication of emergency
alerts. 
The platform also encourages collaborative efforts with student clubs to spread health awareness
through seminars and blogs. Other features include a mechanism for reporting and addressing
issues with campus sanitation and a 24/7 medicine bank for students in need. Campus authorities
have access to the platform for monitoring and resolving issues.
4 important aspects of Campus Health Hub includes:
- Alert System
- Doctor's Appointment system
- Cleanliness
- Student Forum

Our goal is to minimise the time taken to address an emergency and improve the healthcare system of educational instituions.
