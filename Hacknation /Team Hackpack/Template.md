## About Project
Unclaimed is a tech product made to track your stuff, may it be objects, your pets, or anything you value or care.

It works by providing users with unique QR codes for each object of the user.The QR generated can be downloaded and pasted on the objects. Anyone can simply scan the code, this provides an email and SMS notification to the right owner with the time, date and location where the object was scanned. Along with that, the person who scanned gets the mail id of the owner to let them reach their object.

The owner can always track all the objects with their recent locations along with the time. Furthermore, this tech is not limited to only inanimate objects. It can be used to create a tracking system for your pets, cattle etc to never lose them.

The project is further strengthened by use of Web3 Tech to create unique Hash IDs and secure the belongings of the user. Further modifications can easily be made to mint each object and uniquely define each object to identify everything.
