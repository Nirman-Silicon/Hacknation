## About Project - 
Problem Statement
The students face numerous problems in managing their college whereabouts - managing their academics,  attendance, maintaining their presence in club events and networking with their seniors.
Since every college and its clubs do not have a centralised app to ease out the woes. Amidst all chaos in their college life, they tend to fail in maintaining and organising all these.


Solution Statement
We will be building a centralised app for colleges and its clubs. An app that would contain - 
- A calendar where the upcoming events of clubs, college tests, quizzes will be added automatically to the respective club members or college students.
-An automatic attendance calculator that shows the minimum classes to attend for requisite attendance, 
-A personalised to-do list for the user to remain organised
-Club admins can share about any upcoming events 
-Admins can add the quiz, vivas, submission dates of assignment for users to get notified









*Tech stack*: Flutter, Firebase, DialogFlow
