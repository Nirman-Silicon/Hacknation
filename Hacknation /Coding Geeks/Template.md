## About Project
Problem Statement
In today's scenario getting money at the right time at the right place is becoming really difficult day by day so people who really want to contribute towards social causes find it tough to rely on a platform through which they can transfer funds..

Solution
As it is said value of life is not in its duration but in its donation , We want to create a fund raising platform where trending global , national or personal issues can be sorted by active donors . Here users can also interact with each other on that issue 
which can alter the status level of that issue thus making it even more popular



**Tech stack**:
Next.js
MongoDB
NodeJS+Express
JavaScript
Bootstrap
Stripe

 

## Use Cases of your project
Giving is not just about donation it is about making difference , our main moto of making a fund raising platform is not donation only but also making difference in our society by contributing for a social cause in an unified manner , There Can't be a more noble work than saving a human life or changing his/her purpose of life, Therefore we want to provide a platform which solves these problem by having such peoples back who really want our society or individuals to grow.
