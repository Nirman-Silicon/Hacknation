## About Project
Our  module will use a current sensor, NodeMCU with Wi-Fi, and MQTT and placed before and after an LED panel to detect malfunctioning  if we found any error the data will be sent to the company for analysis via a local server







**Tech stack**:
c,c++, adruino IDE

 

## Use Cases of your project
Efficient Maintenance: The engineers can use the information to quickly locate and repair the lights, reducing the time and cost associated with maintaining the lighting infrastructure.
Energy Conservation: By repairing the lights promptly, energy consumption can be reduced and associated cost savings can be achieved.
Public Safety:Non-functional streetlights can pose a risk to public safety, as they can create dark spots that are susceptible to criminal activities. The automated feedback system can help identify non-functional streetlights, allowing engineers to repair them promptly and reduce the risk to public safety.
Better Citizen Engagement: This can improve the transparency of the maintenance process and provide citizens with greater visibility into how the lighting infrastructure is being maintained
