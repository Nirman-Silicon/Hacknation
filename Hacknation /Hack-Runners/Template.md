## About Project
Problem Statement -In today's scenario the most common thing observed isforgetfulness and negligence of people towards their culture and traditions.
A lot of misunderstandings and lack of knowledge between people of various cultures happen,
leading to never ending conflicts which are often insignificant in reality.
Uncertainty in the accuracy or relevance of the information that is being spread.

Solution-
1.We plan on creating a platform for people from various cultures and traditions to share information and tales which they observe remotely in their locality.

2.We also intend to make people aware of the real practices and customs to make them sure about each other’s traditions and avoid conflicts happening due to lack of proper information.

3.Upon receiving all the data, we aim to implement surveys and also provide a report  based on AI on various social aspects that often remain hidden from the entire community.

4.Through this website, we plan on successfully changing the stereotypical mindset of people when they see their peer communities adapting a better lifestyle and positive psychological thinking.
