## About Project
It is evident from the first slide that there has been a sharp decline in the percentage of deaths in Odisha due to the natural calamities in the last two decades. However, we also need to focus on the factors which result in financial loss to the state such as agricultural damage. Thus we need to lookout for both the human loss as well as agricultural loss. Our website aims the same by aiding the government in itâ€™s efforts to help the people by encouraging the public to assist those in need of the required support and save the mankind and also prevent the agricultural damage. Those in the desired age group are requested to volunteer.
