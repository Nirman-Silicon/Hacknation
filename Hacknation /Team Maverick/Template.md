## About Project: Mental health issues are at rise in the contemporary world and the detrimental social stigma - labeling people suffering from mental health issues as mad adds to the issue. So, there's a need to develop an online mental health consultation platform, where the sufferer would be able to get counseling and consultation online, thereby bypassing the social stigma.

Major Focused Area
Anxiety and Stress
Depression
ADHD and Teenage Issues
Psychosis and Trauma

Solution
Our solution is to build a mental health consultation in which users can not only contact a mental health expert but also can make their own mental health and lifestyle better in a gamified version.
The features of our app will be âž–
Online mental health consultation
Self care for patients 
Real Time interaction with consultants over videos and chat 
Blogs written by various specialized doctors
Dashboard for doctors to receive the appointments
Reviews by various patients which will help other patients to analyze the doctor's track record.
The application will be recreational. People have to choose any 3 of the activities they like to do and people with same recreational activities can bond up and work together share their experience, so it'll help them heal and make people feel less lonely
To keep people more engaged in a gamified version- we can add up various small day to day tasks like simple yoga or watering the plants so people engage themselves and after every task they do the task bar goes up and they are given badges of completion to give them a morale boost.
