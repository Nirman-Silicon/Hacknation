## About Project
There is no particular website which handles all the information related to sports in our college. Many students don’t get to know about the upcoming sports events which occurs within and outside of our campus. Student don’t know about the rules and regulations of sports complex and the process and criteria to join a particular sports club.

We will develop an integrated website for the college which will have all the services related to sports like upcoming events will be published on the website, all the photos videos will be uploaded on the website when our college athletes represent our college in sports events. Easy availability of form in the website to join any sports club in the college. Details of the FIC , secretary of sports and coordinator of each game so that anyone can contact them in case of any issue. Proper rules and regulations related to sports complex will be there. Display of all the achievements of our college. Promote to join sports club for better development of students.
