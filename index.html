            <h1> PROBLEM STATEMENT !</h1>
            <br>
            <p>There are over 45 million individuals worldwide who are bilaterally blind.<br>Over 35 million with impaired visions and more than180 million people  who are in some way <br>severely visually disabled . In a study it is estimated that nearly 4.9 million people suffer from corneal<br> blindness and are looking for eye donations across the world and with a significant demand in India as well.
               <br> However, eye donation is a cumbersome process, especially for a densly populated country like India. <br>Therefore we bring forth an easy and conviniway  for you to donate as well as<br> accept the gift of vision.blindness is a major around the world today and approximately every 4 out of<br> 10 new born are blind and a lot lose  their in their lifetime ,but due to lack of awareness<br> and proper facilities ,eye donation becomes a ruckus process which becomes a major challenge.<br>
               The current transplantation scale is minimal in India which is approximately 28000.<br> (Source: Eye Banks Association Of India ) as compared to the demand for the same. In fulfilling<br> n the need of these individuals we aim to campaign for eye donations. The initiative is unique in a sense that<br> we are using web application software platform and networking concepts to improve the effectiveness and efficiency<br> of the current campaigning system by eye banks, eye hospitals and associations in India.<br>

            </p>
            <br>
            <h1> WHY EYE DONATION IS IMPORTANT ??</h1>
            <br>
            <p>
                Blindness is a major cause of concern around the world today. According to WHO,,<br> after cataract and glaucoma, blindness is mostly caused by corneal impairments.<br> Most of these impairments are curable, specially through eye donation, which refers to donating<br> one’s eyes after death. Just like any other body organ, the cornea of the eye can also be donated after death <br>which will render vision to the blind.
                However, due to lack of awareness,<br> social or religious reserves, etc., eye donation is yet get it’s due importance in our country. <br>Thus, to raise awareness among the masses on eye donation, the National Eye Donation <br>Fortnight is observed from August 25 to September 8 every year. Donated eyes are used <br>to restore vision in people suffering from corneal blindness. Cornea is the clear<br> tissue covering the front of the eye. If it is impaired, vision is reduced or lost. In such cases,<br> vision can be restored by a simple surgery called keratoplasty wherein the cornea is replaced. As of today,<br> there is no other solution for corneal blindness than the replacement of cornea.<br>

            <h1> WHY US ??</h1>
            <br>
            <p>
                The platform to campaign is  a web application platform where people who are willing <br>to donate their eyes and those are in search of eyes.people who are interested for this cause can also join us<br> to create awareness among people about the importance of eye donation through various online events.<br>
                our website basically acts as a interface to connect donor and acceptor along with eye banks.<br>when a donor registers ,their profile will be created and their status will be updated as donor<br>then your name will be sortlisted according to your locality.<br>when a person registers as a reciever ,their profile will be created as reciever.<br>
                once a donor is found in a nearby locality ,a mail will be sent specifying the time ,day ,date and details of donor.<br>then a mail will be sent to donor (whose time period for donating eyes is served).<br>with all precaution measures and proper diagnosis ,the eyes will be transformed .<br>
                even people can join us for serving the purpose of the cause .<br>
