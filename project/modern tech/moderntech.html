    <h1><center>Modern Technologies that made Farming Smarter</center></h1>
    <h2 style="color: red;">1. Soil and crop sensors</h2>
    Today, more farm equipment is available with smart sensors that can read everything from crop health to essential nitrogen levels in the water. The sensors then enable on-the-go applications of input based on real-time field conditions.

Sensor technology is also available to measure the electrical conductivity of soil, ground floor, organic matter content, and even soil characteristics such as pH. For example, Varis Technologies, Bionics, and Dulem all produce different types of soil sensors. This is one important Modern agriculture Technology.

    <h2 style="color: red;">2. Crops Connected with Wi-Fi</h2>
    Modern farms usually have electronic sensors distributed in the field that can monitor for different conditions; In some cases, gadgets send data to an on-the-farm server or cloud (network servers are widely used for computing and data processing). One such example of this precision farming NE solution is the Hi-Line Co-op platform that integrates soil sampling, satellite imagery mapping, and harvest data to help create customized variable rate prescriptions for your farm.

    <h2 style="color: red;">3. BUS Technology</h2>
    Ten years ago, displaying up to five in a stream of wires hanging from one edge of the wire to the rear window with tractor-controlled equipment was not uncommon. Today, those monitors are called virtual terminals on one screen. Together the wire has formed a large cable called a binary unit system (BUS) that plugs into any implementation brand. That is why BUS Technology is important in Modern agriculture Technology.

Enabled technology is called ISOBUS, a communications protocol based on agricultural electronics standard ISO 11783 and Controller Area Network or Cannabis technology.

    <h2 style="color: red;">4. Robot Farmer</h2>
    The development of self-driving cars is also accelerating on the farm. Self-driving tractors and robots are becoming more common as a way to automatically control the cost of payroll from time to time done by humans. There are robots to choose lettuce and strawberries, grass, oranges, and cut grapes.

Some are attached to a human-powered tractor while some are highly customizable with sensors and attachments that perform very specific tasks, such as finding out where the cows are pollinated and treating to stimulate the affected grass to grow again. These robots are often guided by precise GPS tracking so they can easily navigate the narrow space between rows of crops.

    <h2 style="color: red;">5. Wavelength Management</h2>
    Urban and vertical home farming is becoming more popular, which gives growers of certain crops a year-round way to grow, regardless of the weather outside. But one of the challenges is how to create the ideal wavelength of sunlight adapted to the growth of compressed indoor spaces.

While indoor lighting has traditionally been used by energy-intensive and expensive full-spectrum fluorescent lighting to promote plant growth, advances in light-emitting diodes (LEDs) in recent years have provided a cheaper and better alternative. Modern agriculture technology makes Farming easier and smarter.
